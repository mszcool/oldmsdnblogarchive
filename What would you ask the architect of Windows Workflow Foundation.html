<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I am really looking forward to our next architect forum this Thursday. Our special guest star this time: Dave Green, architect within the Windows Workflow Foundation team at Microsoft Corp.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Finally we have put together a panel discussion for the forum. So I'd like to ask you - what would you ask the architect of Windows Workflow foundation? Do you have similar questions as I have (see <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2006/09/04/740138.aspx">my last post</A>)? Do you have any questions according to standards (BPEL, BPMN, BPMI, WfMC...)? Proven practices and workflow patterns?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Let me know by just adding a comment to this post, I'll definitely forward your question:) Finally my dream of this is creating a whitepaper with the members of the architect forum. Of course we'll publish this paper through our <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msdnat">austrian MSDN blog</A>...</FONT></P></div>
