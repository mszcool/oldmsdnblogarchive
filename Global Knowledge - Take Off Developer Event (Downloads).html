<div id='content'><p>Today I spend nearly the whole day at the <a title="Global Knowledge Take Off Developer Event" href="http://www.globalknowledge.at/neuigkeiten/veranstaltungen/software_developent_day.aspx">Global Knowledge Take Off Developer event</a> organized by Global Knowledge and <a title="Christian Nagel" href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cnagel/">Christian Nagel</a>. I had the honor to deliver today's key note as well as foundation-session on <a title="WCF" href="http://wcf.netfx3.com">Windows Communication Foundation</a> (WCF). </p> <p>In the key note I tried to build the bridge from current market trends such as Service Orientation, BPM, Web 2.0, Generation "U" and S+S to our Connected Systems&nbsp;stack. The reason for doing so is, that&nbsp;Connected System addresses parts of these market trends&nbsp;and with .NET 3.0 we address&nbsp;4 of the&nbsp;5 parts of our Connected Systems&nbsp;"technology model". This all is - in my opinion - to&nbsp;address parts of the trends we are currently faced with on the&nbsp;market (Web 2.0 -&gt; longtail -&gt; importance of consumer orientation -&gt; user experience -&gt; WPF as a part of user experience).</p> <p>As the WCF session was just 45 min. long (okay, it took me 55 min.;) I had the chance to cover the basics around WCF's architecture and the ABCs, only. In general I think the event went very well...</p> <p>I really hope the attendees liked my presentations (two very contrary ones -&nbsp;one very abstract and conceptual and the other one pure fashioned coding;).</p> <p>You can finde <a title="Global Knowledge Slides" href="http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/042007_GlobalKnowledgeTakeOffDev/GlobalKnowledgeSlides.zip">the slides for download here</a> and my <a title="WCF Demo Download" href="http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/042007_GlobalKnowledgeTakeOffDev/GlobalWCFDemo.zip">WCF demo for download here</a>...</p></div>
