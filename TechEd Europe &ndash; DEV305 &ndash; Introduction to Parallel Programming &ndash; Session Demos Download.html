<div id='content'><p>I was just coming back from my first session at TechEd on parallel programming before I started blogging again. That might be because I fell much better after this first session at the conference. It was such a great fun doing it, I was in a room that was for more than 900 people and the room was packed with attendees until the very first minute, I think no one left. So I finally hope the people liked the session… given the fact that I am also responsible for the architecture track it is really a challenge doing that all together in a week…</p>  <p>With this blog-post I want to provide the sample-code that I’ve created during the presentation. The presentation-material is available through the TechEd network:</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Presentations/20101110-DEV305-ParallelSessionDemosTechEd.zip">Click here to get to the download of the sample-code for my parallel-computing session.</a></p>  <p>Here is a picture to give you a sense of how great it was being here one more time at TechEd (and I don’t know if there will be a further time I will go – time is changing…). <strong>Thanks a lot to all attendees for your interest and for staying in the session – I really enjoyed it and I hope you learned something out of it, as well!!</strong></p>  <p><a href="media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/32/26/metablogapi/3324.CIMG0057_09A9E31D.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-32-26-metablogapi/3324.CIMG0057_5F00_09A9E31D.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="CIMG0057" border="0" alt="CIMG0057" src="media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/32/26/metablogapi/0216.CIMG0057_thumb_7F851C24.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-32-26-metablogapi/0216.CIMG0057_5F00_thumb_5F00_7F851C24.jpg" width="644" height="484" /></a></p>  <p>If you have any questions, feel free getting back to me<img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/32/26/metablogapi/1185.wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_3B150518.png" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-32-26-metablogapi/1185.wlEmoticon_2D00_winkingsmile_5F00_3B150518.png" />!!</p></div>
