<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Today I travelled a little bit for the <EM>Microsoft Global Account Team</EM> and the <EM>EMEA Microsoft Services</EM> team... to Warsaw to visit <A href="http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/International/Home">Ernst &amp; Young</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>We did a whole day workshop on ASP.NET 2.0... starting at 09:30. Around 9:45 I started the first demo and finished of with it shortly before 11:45. Then we decided to continue just doing demos - so finally it was a whole day showing them, what's in ASP.NET 2.0. Great workshop, but still there would have been so many things to show them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>If you are interested in the demos, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/attachment/730636.ashx">just download them here</A>. The examples cover typical things such as MasterPages, Themes, the new Data Source controls including ObjectDataSource, SqlCacheDependency, Resources and Localization including a custom, localizable control, dynamically switching Themes at runtime and the most important control news.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The demos are ready-to-run when you have VS 2005 and SQL 2005 Express Edition installed (database&nbsp;in App_Data, connectionString goes to (local)\SQLExpress).</FONT></P>
