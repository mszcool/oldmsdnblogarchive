<div id='content'><p>Last Tuesday a few of our biggest partners (CSS, Cubido and TechTalk) organized their second DevCamp conference in Vienna... and again I have to say it was a great event. While most of the sessions where delivered by peers from our partners, Max and I delivered several presentations and the key note as well.</p>  <p>Btw., Max found a few really cool tools while preparing for the presentation and even better, he <strong>created some project templates and wizards</strong> for using the <strong>Composite WPF Guidance</strong> in a more effective way in Visual Studio... <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom">check out his blog</a> for the project templates and the tools...</p>  <p>By clicking the links below you can download the presentation material from my sessions. As promised, I will blog a step-by-step introduction to make the .NET - Java / Glassfish WS-Trust / Identity interop-demo working in your machine in a later post...</p>  <p><a href="http://www.mszcool.com/Blog%20Downloads/2008/200810%20-%20DevCamp%20Key%20Note.pdf">Click here to download my key-note presentation.</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.mszcool.com/Blog%20Downloads/2008/200810%20-%20DevCamp%20Identity%20MetaSystem%20Presentation.pdf">Click here to download the Identity Meta System session.</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.mszcool.com/Blog%20Downloads/2008/200810%20-%20DevCamp%20Office%20Enterprise%202.0%20Presentation.pdf">Click here to download the Office SharePoint Enterprise 2.0 session.</a></p>  <p>Cheers   <br /><strong>Mario</strong></p></div>
