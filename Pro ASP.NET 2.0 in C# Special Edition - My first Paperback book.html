<P>Finally Matthew and I did it - it's out. This summer during my vacation we finished our work for <A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">the special edition of Pro ASP.NET 2.0 in C#</A>. And it's available <A class="" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">on Amazon</A> already. It was really hard work as Apress wanted us to do this in a very short amout of time. We extended the book with some great content based on the feedback we've got in the past months from readers and during real-world projects. And we addressed the AJAX hype and unveiled more technical details on AJAX in ASP.NET incl. ATLAS preview. And it's finally our first paper-back book:)...</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
