<div id='content'><P>As announced in the previous blog, publishing technical papers about interesting architectural concepts from customer and partner engagements is going to be a focus for me from this time forward.</P>
<P><A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/attachment/8575651.ashx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/attachment/8575651.ashx">Click here for downloading this first&nbsp;paper in the series!</A></P>
<P>This is the first paper in this series since my personal blog.restart() and it is about a WPF Smart Client enterprise project we've been working on in the past couple of months.</P>
<P>HP <A href="http://www.banqpro.at/" mce_href="http://www.banqpro.at">banqpro/</A> is one of the most well-known banking products here in Austria and it is used by several large customers across the country. The <A href="http://www.banqpro.at/" mce_href="http://www.banqpro.at">banqpro/</A>-team is currently working on a new front-end experience based on <A href="http://wpf.netfx3.com/" mce_href="http://wpf.netfx3.com">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</A> and the .NET Framework 3.x.</P>
<P><STRONG>The white-paper I have attached to this blog describes the architectural concepts we've applied for building this WPF-based smart client. The paper especially emphasizes on motivations and architectural concepts for integrating workflows into Smart Clients of this category. It was one of the primary future requirements for <A href="http://www.banqpro.at/" mce_href="http://www.banqpro.at">banqpro/</A>.</STRONG></P>
<P>Note that this is an architectural paper - it talks about concepts and strategies, not about coding details!</P>
