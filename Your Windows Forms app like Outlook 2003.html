<div id='content'><P>Wow,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;really hard for me blogging something in the past weeks, so many things to do... First I had to prepare content for our <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/vbnettour.mspx">local VB.NET Trainingstour</A> we are doing with VS 2005 and then the ISV Community day (that's gona happen tomorrow and ... well ...&nbsp;IBF is sooo cool but hard as well:-)) and of course some Web Casts for our trainings tour in between the actual trainings.</P>
<P>Today I had&nbsp;the first&nbsp;Web Cast for this VB.NET trainings tour... It's really a special experience talking more than one hour to your computer:-) but I think the demo I did on the fly is (although still Beta 1 as we use that for the tour because Beta 2 wasn't ready when we started) quite nice. I have taken a look at the channel 9 videos by Joe Stagman&nbsp;(<A href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=21657">https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=21657</A>&nbsp;and <A href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23875#23875">https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23875#23875</A>) and just have done a similar sample completly within the web cast on my own. Just download it <A href="http://www.dotnetexperts.at/Controls/ImageView/Image.aspx?FileId=7a53f6e6-b80c-4746-93e1-a2ea20c28f57">here</A>...</P></div>
