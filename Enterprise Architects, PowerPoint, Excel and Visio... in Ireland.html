<div id='content'><p>Three weeks ago I'd did a presentation in Ireland at an architects forum on user experience. This presentation was for the LEAP (Lead Enterprise Architects Forum), which is a type of forum held in just a couple of countries across EMEA. It was really a special experience for me as it confirmed some thoughts and learnings I had in the past couple of years - and especially since I started the new role as an architect evangelist. ...And... as I still meet too many geeks which tend to drive decisions "just" on "cool technologies", I want to share this experience...</p> <p>After the presentation, which went really well, I had a conversation with some of the architects (from Cap Gemini, Accenture, HP etc.).&nbsp;And many of the attendees said "my primary tool is PowerPoint and Excel... and sometimes Visio...".&nbsp;And why? Well, because most of them are persons "preparing" decisions and making decisions in context of business and strategy! That means these decisions are definitely not technology-decisions at first place. Rather the&nbsp;technology-decisions&nbsp;are just a result of their work after understanding the business and strategy, but not their primary work.</p> <p>And that's exactly the point I'd like to make here: almost too often "Geeks" out there tend to make decisions on a pure technology-basis which isn't really the way it should be! That's just the reason why I can't hear statements such as "Office development isn't cool, therefore I do it on my own..." or "Our strategy is TECHNOLOGY-X" or "Tell me more about this technology and then I know what I want to do..." anymore... I mean, how can a technology be strategy? And... shouldn't you&nbsp;know what you want to do before we talk about technologies? It's that simple, isn't it?</p> <p>Want more, just take a look at&nbsp;<a title="Software Architect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect">a definition of "Software Architect"</a>&nbsp;:))</p></div>
