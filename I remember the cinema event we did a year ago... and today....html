<div id='content'><P>...we are doing another one together with <A href="https://s.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/connection/default.mspx">MSDN Connection Austria</A>. But this time we are doing it the other way round: first go to cinema, then code something and finally win&nbsp;one of three really&nbsp;cool prices if you are one of the three best coders... </P>
<P>The first 500 registrations for <A href="https://s.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/connection/default.mspx">MSDN Connection Austria</A> will get a <STRONG>free ticket for </STRONG><A href="http://www.skip.at/AT/filme/filminfo_ev.php?filmnr=7052"><STRONG>a cool film</STRONG></A> and get the possibility of <STRONG>participating in a coding contest</STRONG> we will introduce at the cinema right before the film starts (yes, as developer I can't do just a movie in cinema without some content for developers before:) ... so you will get some interesting and funny security-related information before the film starts... to prepare you for the coding-contest;))</P>
<P>It would be really cool meeting you at the cinema ... and&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;(oh yes, I will participate as well)&nbsp;you at the coding contest afterwards...</P></div>
