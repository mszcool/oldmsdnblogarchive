Together with Andreas Hejl from Siemens we were able to organize superb speakers for the conference.</p>  <p><a title="http://www.microsoft.com/austria/architectconference" href="http://www.microsoft.com/austria/architectconference">http://www.microsoft.com/austria/architectconference</a></p>  <p>I think this could be a great platform for experience-exchange, for discussing technical and conceptual ideas and for getting the latest and greatest information on Microsoft’s strategies for hot topics such as</p>  <p align="center"><strong>Cloud Computing     <br />Parallel Computing</strong>    <br /><strong>Patterns &amp; Practices     <br />Methodologies &amp; Processes</strong></p>  <p>The speakers we’ve organized are international and local industry experts which are not coming to Austria so often:) To name just a few of them:</p>  <p align="center"><strong>Ulrich Homann, Chief Architect Microsoft Services World Wide     <br />Dr. Michael Stal, Senior Principal Engineer &amp; Team Lead, Siemens Corporate Research      <br />Beat Schwegler, Enterprise Lead, Microsoft Western Europe Head Quarters      <br />Mitch Lacey, Mitch Lacey &amp; Associates Inc., International Expert on Agile      <br />Christian Weyer, Co-Founder, Thinktecture, Microsoft Regional Director Germany      <br />Ralf Westphal, Most Valued Professional for Microsoft, Germany</strong></p>  <p align="left">But of course the conference lives and dies with YOU – architects and architecture-interested people which are willing to challenge our presenters, discuss with them and exchange opinions and experience.</p>  <p align="left">I am looking forward to meet you at this conference – it is going to be a special event for several reasons as things are going to change for me right now;)… so don’t miss this conference, join us with this highlight of our architecture community…</p></div>
