<div id='content'><p><em>Azure Batch is a completely managed service, you could see it as “batch processing as a service”. </em>It can be used for simple batch processing up to High-Performance-Compute (HPC) types of workloads. As such it fills the gap we tried to fill over the past year with GeRes2, an open source framework for batch-processing with Web/Worker Roles. From this time forward we fully recommend using Azure Batch instead of GeRes2.</p>  <p>To help you getting started, I built a comprehensive sample inspired by Mark Scurrell’s session at TechEd Europe that does OCR recognition with Tesseract on Azure Batch.</p>  <p>Interested in the sample as well as a complete PowerShell script that sets everything up for you in a fully automated way?
