<div id='content'><P>Finally I made it to get to the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/">TechEd Europe 2004 in Amsterdam</A> - but not just as attendee :-)). If you have any questions according to .NET, ASP.NET, Web Services, security (my current favourite and special topic)&nbsp;or some other developer related topics you'll be able to find me at the Ask the Experts booths. Yes, that was the ticket to get there :-))</P>
<P>I am very glad about that as I am the first time at TechEd at all - I'll share the booths with one of my other colleagues (Georg, thanks to him - he showed me how to get there)&nbsp;- together we will definitely be a&nbsp;great team. Also my colleague, Beat, is doing some amazing sessions (I hope that I'll be able to join at least one of them). Just take a look at <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/beatsch/archive/2004/06/13/154644.aspx">his last blog entry</A>.</P></div>
