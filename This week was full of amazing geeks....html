<div id='content'><P>This week I meet more cool geeks and speakers from Europe than the whole last year;-) First we had our Whidbey Ascend training which was really great and ISVs and Enterprise customers participated on the training really liked it. Of course no surprise when having <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/">Christian Weyer</A>, <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cnagel/">Christian Nagel </A>and <A href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens Vasters </A>as trainers ... they have really delivered hard core cool content.&nbsp;Oh yes, and I think we (as the small sub;-)) are the only sub where every single attendee (44!!) got a specifically for the training prepared VPC image on DVD I prepared together with a colleague overnight (thanks to Stefan from our IT department;-)).</P>
<P>And today we are hosting the europe MVP summit here. I am really happy having experts like <A href="http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/weblog/">Ingo Rammer </A>(thank you&nbsp;for giving&nbsp;me the chance of becoming the Co-Author of your great book Advanced .NET Remoting for the 2nd edition ... I really liked working with Ingo:-)), <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/hpreishuber/">Hannes Preishuber</A>, <A href="http://chrison.net/">Christoph Wille</A> and lots of other geeks from the MVP community. I am really waiting for an evening full of fun today as we have planned a typical Austrian dinner with hopefully lots of beer for them.</P></div>
