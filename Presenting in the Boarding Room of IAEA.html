<div id='content'><P>Today Alex and I did a full-day workshop about .NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005&nbsp;for the<A href="http://www.iaea.org"> International Atomic Energy Agency </A>... and the great thing about that is when doing such a whole day workshop there for the development teams across their departments they book their <STRONG>Boarding Room</STRONG> for this event. That's really great - I still remember the first presentation there together with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/beatsch">Beat</A> (our Security talk). Doing a presentation in the boarding room where international decisions are done is really cool ... and much more I like the chairs and tables there. Those large, comfortable, huge chairs are just great (and honestly it's they really lead into temptation of relaxing a little bit too much:-))... And as you have the translation-rooms on top of the room around you, I really had the feeling of being translated into 6-7 different languages. Here you have a picture of it. Maybe you get a feeling what I am talking about (but don't forget - we had those huge chairs and not this simple chairs from the picture - those huge chairs similar to the ones in a parliament...).</P>

<P>Anyway - that's just a great experience. If you are interested in more pictures just go to their <A href="http://f40.iaea.org/worldatom/Press/Multimedia/Imagebase/hq.shtml">image-base</A>.</P></div>
