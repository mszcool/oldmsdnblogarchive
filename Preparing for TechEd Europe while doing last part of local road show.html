<div id='content'><P>Two weeks ago we started with our local road show called <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/austria/bigdays">Big&gt;Days</A> through Austria. For our developer track I have prepared three sessions full of "exploring new things of Visual Studio 2005 and .NET 2.0" and Alex has prepared a session about SQL Server 2005. While today we start traveling to the last two locations, Linz and Graz, this week, I have uploaded my persentations for <EM>Teched Europe in Amsterdam</EM>.</P>
<P>In Amsterdam I'll talk about the experience I made with developing Office 2003 solutions with Smart Documents and&nbsp;XML integration (I have worked on a huge proof of concept in this space with one of our largest ISVs, <A href="http://www.datasystems.at">Data Systems Austria</A>). This is the session's abstract:</P>

<P><SPAN class=sessionTitle id=DataGrid1__ctl3_Label5><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Developing Real World Smart Documents with .NET</STRONG><BR><SPAN class=sessionAbstract id=DataGrid1__ctl3_Label6>Smart Documents provide an infrastructure for creating task panels running within Microsoft Word 2003 and Microsoft Excel 2003. By leveraging different backend systems through the XML capabilities of Microsoft Office 2003 they finally assist information workers with the creation of business documents. While developing a basic Smart Document is fairly easy there are some key success factors for sophisticated solutions. Apart from fundamentals like dealing with the documentâ€™s life cycle this session covers key topics for successfully creating Smart Document solutions: Designing appropriate XML schemas, managing state across multiple document instances and creating reusable UI code and XML schema types. All this will be based on a sample framework which has been developed for a real world application. Learn the key success factors for developing Smart Document solutions with Visual Studio .NET 2003/2005 and start making information workers life easier.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><SPAN class=sessionTitle><SPAN class=sessionAbstract>In this session I'll cover how to develop smart documents (VS 2003 <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=94197D33-82A3-4912-88D1-3BF0F783C5E2">with&nbsp;the&nbsp;framework we have developed in the&nbsp;proof of concept</A>&nbsp;(it's already in production for the ISV) and VS 2005) and then put all the things together through talking about the <STRONG>key success factors</STRONG>: correct <STRONG>XML schema design for documents</STRONG> (which is inherently different from "message" schema design) and how you can <STRONG>design your components for <SPAN class=sessionabstract><SPAN>reusability</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG>.</SPAN></SPAN></P></div>
