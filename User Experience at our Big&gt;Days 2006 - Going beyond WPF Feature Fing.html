<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have just finished putting together the content four our next MSDN Flash - except the editorial. Actually I wanted to write some more things about user experience.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>Then I remembered, that I will do the Windows Presentation Foundation developer session at </FONT><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/austria/events/bigdays/default.mspx"><FONT size=2>Big&gt;Days</FONT></A><FONT size=2> (see more content details on </FONT><A HREF="/leitenmu/archive/2006/03/09/547213.aspx"><FONT size=2>Haralds blog</FONT></A><FONT size=2>). I already did a couple of samples, demos and presentations on that topic and I think I know some features fearly well. But all these presentations had one commonality: they where all about WPF hard-core features. Yes, cool features, for hard-core developers. But I think features are not worth the time when not thinking about scenarios.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Actually I got some ideas from customer projects I was involved where applications should "show the user's" through animations&nbsp;what they need to do. But at the end the story is a little bit more, isn't it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Honestly although I think talking about user experience is really a very important thing. Bringing together <STRONG>productivity-aspects</STRONG> and especially <STRONG>emotional aspects</STRONG> is essential! Whether we want to have it or not! It's true and for users it makes the difference between just good and really cool applications (yes, do you think users will either talk about good or cool applications?).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I really want to do a presentation developers really like and find useful at Big&gt;Days! Personally for that I'd combine usage scenarios in context of user experience with technical education. But honestly I am afraid that developers might find "user experience" as marketing...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>At the end I am not quite sure, which strategy I should go for structuring the presentation - the classic feature-by-feature (which I know works in most cases) or a scenario based (which requires me to really focus on "user experience" and let the technology be just a "tool for getting it done") presentation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>So... what I want to do, is, leaving it up to you - the attendee! Please give me feedback of what you would expect in my WPF session to see and if you rather would like to go for it feature-by-feature or through sharing new ideas and concepts about leveraging the technology for next-generation user experience...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any comment would be really great and would help me creating a presentation which is really useful to YOU... I will read each and every comment to this blog and will integrate it thoroughly into my presentation - promised!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Oh yeah, and if you have any crazy ideas about special scenarios for animations, videos in buttons (joke:)) or similar things - share your ideas with me and we'll discuss about them...</FONT></P></div>
