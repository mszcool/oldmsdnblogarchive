<div id='content'><P>Last week in our team JourFixe we had a short presentation from Barbara, event owner of the Big&gt;Days 2007 road show, on statistics and event evaluations. I am really very happy that - in terms of session and presentaiton quality - the four top-sessions are from the developer sessions <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom">Max</A> put together and organized for our tracks - congratulations:)</P>
<P>The first three sessions in the ranking are mine... which makes me really happy as well as putting them together was very stressful:) here are the evaluations of my sessions (1 = best, 9 = worst):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Office Developer Demo (Restaurant Community): <B>1,44</B><BR>Office SharePoint Server (Excel &amp; InfoPath Forms Services): <B>1,47</B><BR>Web Designer meets Web Developer: <B>1,70</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The biggest surprise for me was the InfoPath and Excel session as I did not have many code in that session. But maybe the things I addressed there are solving many common problems out there:)</P>
<P>It was definitely a great road show and I really enjoyed it... once again, but this time with a new and great track owner. Congrats for cool developer tracks, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom">Max</A>:)</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Important: if you have any feedback to the sessions and to our content in general, please contact <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom">Max</A> or me through our blogs! This is much more important than the numbers above:))</EM></STRONG></P></div>
