<div id='content'><p>As I did a code hacking demo on one of our events hacking an application through a SQL Injection attack and getting control of the whole machine through xp_cmdshell and netcat I have got many questions about the tools and how-tos from customers for security penetration tests (although doing this test alone is definitely not enough).</p> <p>Although it's easy finding tools like netcat.exe in web and port scanners or port mappers, it's very easy writing the tools on your own. Just take a look at the following book called <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584503149/qid=1102587996/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/028-0941931-0784543">Code Hacking</a> ... really cool very interesting stuff.</p></div>
