<div id='content'><p>Last week I did a presentation at the technical university of Vienna on Microsoft's strategies for modeling and Software Factories. It was a great pleasure and fun for me to deliver this presentation as we had really interesting discussions afterwards with students on these topics.</p>  <p>Below you can find the assets I produced for this presentation as downloads:</p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://cid-c57a431d03937fc0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/200812%20TU%20Vienna/ModelingStrategy.pdf">PowerPoint Presentation Download (as PDF)</a>    <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cid-c57a431d03937fc0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/200812%20TU%20Vienna/SimpleWSFactory.zip">Simple WCF Service Factory Demo</a>    <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cid-c57a431d03937fc0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/200812%20TU%20Vienna/TestSimpleDSL.zip">Simple Test DSL</a> created with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=59ec6ec3-4273-48a3-ba25-dc925a45584d&amp;DisplayLang=en">VS 2008 SDK</a></p>  <p>Although I haven't been blogging a lot about this topic, yet, I strongly believe in this strategy. Especially since I attended the Strategic Architect Forum where Jack Greenfield clarified on some recent developments publicly announced at PDC 2008 last October. The key-questions Jack answered, are for me:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>UML and Microsoft - Why did Microsoft change it's perception according to UML and includes UML-diagrams with Visual Studio 2010 now while they were claiming it isn't a core strategy?</strong>      <br />Well, simple and pragmatic: my understanding is that we think you can boost your productivity for most software products with factories and DSLs for about 60-80% of the development. For many more &quot;specialized&quot; developments that weren't part of your product-variation planning for some reasons (e.g. ROI) you still need to have structured processes and ways for covering these parts. This is exactly where UML and other general-purpose modeling-approaches can help, definitely. And I think that besides of the fact that customers want us to support UML, that is the major reason for doing so.</li>    <li><strong>How does the future of DSL-Toolkit look like as Microsoft announced OSLO at PDC in October?</strong>      <br />I think the easiest way to answer these questions is taking a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack Greenfields</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent">Stuart Kents</a> blog. Click one of the following links below:</li>    <ul>     <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/07/dsl-tools-and-oslo.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/07/dsl-tools-and-oslo.aspx</a></li>      <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/05/dsl-tools-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2008/11/05/dsl-tools-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx</a></li>      <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/softwarefactories/archive/2008/05/26/software-factories-2-0.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/softwarefactories/archive/2008/05/26/software-factories-2-0.aspx</a></li>      <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/blueprints.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/blueprints.aspx</a></li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>So the answer seems to be pretty simple according to these blog-postings: the much richer successor of GAX/GAT will be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeplex.com/blueprints">Microsoft Blueprints</a>. For DSL Tools and Blueprints the product team wants to have a plan in place for smooth migration. But as I personally think that OSLO will take some more time to complete, I think we have some &quot;time-buffer&quot; here. In the meantime I think DSL-tools are a pretty good way to move on;) Currently I am thinking about creating a DSL for Composite WPF which might be a funny think... depends on how much time I have left in my vacation next week:))</p>  <p>Having that said I wish all of you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year;)</p>  <p><strong>Mario</strong></p></div>
