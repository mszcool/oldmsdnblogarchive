<div id='content'><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Together with George from Microsoft Austria I am working on a demo for Visual Studio Team System. The Demo has been originally prepared by Eric Lee (<a href="http://blog.accentient.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5aae4e43-3ea8-462d-91d0-38500cb5b93d#a5aae4e43-3ea8-462d-91d0-38500cb5b93d">here</a> durinig a VSTS presentation...)&nbsp;from Microsoft ... and ... it rocks like hell. Thanks to Eric Lee who has really created superb instructions for setting up and testing the whole thing...</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But - through all enthusiasm I have for these bits&nbsp;(I mean they are in a very early state and therefore somewhat slow...) - I think that the environment's complexity will change the developer's day-to-day business a "little" bit:-) it changes the focus on what are our tasks and how we are completing these tasks. The complexity of the whole system even leads to the fact that we actually <strong>have to</strong> change our focus for really using it effectively (...it's not enough anymore drawing sketchy diagrams on a white-board and then start coding ... what leads to a gap between the real code and the things on the white-board anyway - and that's what we should try to avoid and where VSTS is definitely a large step forward ... even if I don't think about the long-term future with Software Factories).</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So ... the things are really cool but we'll have to learn lot's of new things and how-to&nbsp;use these powerful tools effectively&nbsp;(that's what makes our business that interesting:-)). Great new challenges...</font></p></div>
