<div id='content'><P>On Tuesday I had an email in my&nbsp;inbox - "Just released, Composite UI block". And actually yesterday Alain Leroy and I did a demo about that thing&nbsp;in the Architecture session "Demystifying the Smart Client" at TechEd. Actually this block provides you with a web-part like framework for creating Smart Client applications that allows you to focus on</P>
<UL>
<LI>Implementing re-usable WorkItems which encapsulate use cases for the users. 
<LI>Base classes for implementing the MVC pattern within a WorkItem by creating Views (so called SmartParts), Controllers and Models (just the data classes). 
<LI>Consolidate a number of WorkItems into Modules which are deployment units for WorkItems. 
<LI>Create a shell that enables you compose your application based on Modules and load the WorkItems in those modules into pre-defined WorkSpaces. 
<LI>Configure the appearance of the Shell through XML-based or any other type of configuration so that the shell changes it's appearance and offered WorkItems based on the user's requirement.</LI></UL>
<P>The important thing from my perspective is really that it supports configurations based on user's role. That means depending on the user's role in the company you can load a number of modules based on the configuration.
