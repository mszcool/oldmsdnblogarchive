<div id='content'><p>Last week, on November 5th 2009, we had our 3rd Interoperability Council in the Microsoft Innovation Center in Vienna. The council is an <a href="media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/3rdInteroperabilityCouncilonNovember5th_10BFA/Interop.%20Council%205.11.2009%20029.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/3rdInteroperabilityCouncilonNovember5th_10BFA/Interop.%20Council%205.11.2009%20029.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Interop.

During the meetings we typically discuss current issues and try to identify ways (processes, approaches etc.) for solving these problems together. We are really running this in a very pragmatic way – as soon as the council identifies benefits for all parties (customers, partners, Microsoft), we try to find ways for taking on the challenges.</p>  <p><strong><u>Results from the council of the previous months</u></strong></p>  <p>The council was founded with his first meeting on February 10th 2009. In this first meeting we also identified a few potential challenges. For two of them we organized what we call interoperability labs, for one I’ve written an article and published it on my blog last week.</p>  <p>In a lab we typically setup 2-3 workshops of 1-2 days with a small&#160; sub-group of the council and experts the members of the council are brining into the game. During these labs we either really work on concrete concepts or even source code (depending on the type of <a href="media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/3rdInteroperabilityCouncilonNovember5th_10BFA/Interop.%20Council%205.11.2009%20025.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/3rdInteroperabilityCouncilonNovember5th_10BFA/Interop.%20Council%205.11.2009%20025.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 10px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Interop.

The idea is really to bring together a group of bright people in a very pragmatic way and try to find ways for dealing with interop-challenges identified by the council. If we come up with concrete results then it’s a success, if not, then we know at least, which further actions we would need to take for dealing with a challenge, how big the necessary investment would be and whether driving further investigations is worthwhile or not! Fortunately with the previous labs we were successful. The results of our council are remarkable:</p>  <p><strong><u>e-card Interop-Lab</u></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://wcfswaencoder.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Published Open Source Components</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.codefest.at/post/2009/10/19/Sicherstellung-der-Kompatibilitat-von-NETWCF-und-den-e-card-Services-UZE-und-ABS-Interoperability-Lab-mit-SV-Chipkarten-Betriebs-und-Errichtungsgesellschaft-mbH-erfolgreich-abgeschlossen!.aspx" target="_blank">Published a business-article (German) on our team-blog</a>    <br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2009/10/19/windows-communication-foundation-and-soap-with-attachments-message-encoder-built-in-interop-lab-with-svc-sozialversicherungs-chipkarten-betriebs-und-errichtungsgesellschaft-m-b-h.aspx" target="_blank">Published a technical article of the results on my blog</a></p>  <p><strong><u>e-Government Portal-Connection-Protocol</u></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://egora.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Published Open Source Components</a>    <br /><a href="http://egora.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=91043" target="_blank">Whitepaper on supporting this Austrian eGovernment standard</a></p>  <p><strong><u>Identity Interoperability</u></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2009/11/05/identity-interop-update-for-our-interoperability-council-adfs-v2-and-wif-interop-with-sun-opensso-novell-access-manager-ca-openid-and-sun-metro-wsit.aspx" target="_blank">Article on Identity Interoperability (incl.
