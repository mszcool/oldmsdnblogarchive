<div id='content'><P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The past two months, May and June, where just amazing. So many events and lots of changes - for me personally as well;)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Yesterday and today we had the last large events before summer - the Office System Developer's Conference and the 16. Architect forum. For the OfficeDevCon I used a enhanced and updated version of the demo I have prepared for BigDays 2006.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Now, that Beta 2 of Office 2007 has arrived, I want to share this demo with you all folks. It really shows, how to put all the things together to a solution: I started with developing a Workflow for Windows SharePoint Services v3 and Workflow Foundation that controls it's flow based on InfoPath Forms submitted to a forms library (Bug Request:)). Then I have extended the SharePoint v3 Web Services infrastructure with custom Web Services where I am using the SharePoint v3 Object Model to get the contents out of the form library and provide the information to client applications. Oh yes, and the last piece is a Excel 2007 and Word 2007 Add-In that extends the Ribbon and adds a custom task pane to get the information from the form library right into the client applications.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Although it would have been possible to solve some things cleaner, I think it is really a nice demo showing the capabilities of the next generation of Office... So download it (attachment of this post), try it and get your ideas out of it...</FONT></P>
