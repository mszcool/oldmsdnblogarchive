<div id='content'><P>I have totally forgotten to mention that <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2008/06/05/hp-banqpro-a-wpf-smart-client-project-with-wf-integration.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2008/06/05/hp-banqpro-a-wpf-smart-client-project-with-wf-integration.aspx">the HP banqpro/ paper</A> was the reasion why I updated my samples from last year's TechEd Europe 2007. Actually I created this examples not just for TechEd but also based on the requirements I've been told by HP in mind to evaluate how hard integration of Workflows in composite smart clients is.</P>
<P>Therefore <A class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2008/06/04/cab-scsf-and-workflow-integration-demo-update-from-last-teched.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2008/06/04/cab-scsf-and-workflow-integration-demo-update-from-last-teched.aspx"><STRONG>click here to check out this demo</STRONG></A> if you want to see parts of the concepts in action... and as mentioned in the paper: really better think twice before you take on the effort and really be sure about the value you get out of it (you can get much out of it if the use case fits, but in many cases it isn't worth the effort:)).</P></div>
