<div id='content'><P>Wow, <A href="http://codefairway.net/de/currenthole.aspx">the tournament</A> we launched with our cinema event last friday is already full in action. We have a number of .NET golf players who already solved the problems with amazing code-size (663 bytes)...</P>
<P>And we had some fun with finding a mistake in either the implementations of the gamers or my tester ... and we where both right ... the mistake was in the test-vector of the whole thing which had some&nbsp;lower-case letters although only&nbsp;captials are supposed to be there:))) My implementation fixed that automatically by converting letters always to upper-case letters but others leaved that out for code-optimization reasons... wow, that was hard to find:)</P></div>
