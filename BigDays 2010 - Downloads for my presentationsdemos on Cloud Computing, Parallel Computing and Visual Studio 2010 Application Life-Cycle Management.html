<div id='content'><p>Wow, what I time was that the past four weeks – BigDays 2010 preparations and rehearsals, then two-week long BigDays-tour through Austria with four sessions + key note demos on each location and now I am sitting at the airport in Zurich heading back from TechDays in Basel where I had two sessions, as well. It was such a great time, I tell you!!</p>  <p>Okay, for the next week you can expect a series of postings on the presentations I gave at our BigDays-tour through our country and TechDays in Basel / Switzerland. And this is the first posting in this series – and the simplest one at the same time:)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.codefest.at/post/2010/03/30/Big3eDays-2010-Developer-Sessions-zu-Web-Entwicklung-und-Visual-Studio-2010-NET-40-online!.aspx">For BigDays 2010, all sessions where recorded in Vienna – these recordings are available, already here.</a></p>  <p>Below are some infos and the download links for the presentations I had at BigDays:</p>  <p><strong>Cloud Computing with Windows Azure Platform      <br /></strong>It was the first session I did together with <strong><a href="http://www.software-architects.at/Blogs/tabid/72/BlogID/5/Default.aspx">Rainer Stropek</a></strong> – and it was simply a great session. I hope the feedback will reflect the feelings I have about this presentation. <a href="http://www.software-architects.at/Blogs/tabid/72/BlogID/5/Default.aspx">Rainer</a> and I migrated an on-premise ASP.NET web application with a local database and local file system access to Windows Azure leveraging Storage, SQL Azure, Queues and Workers. <strong>Thanks for preparing this great demo, Rainer!! </strong>Click on the icons below to download the demo and the presentation.</p> <iframe style="padding-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; padding-left: 0px; width: 98px; padding-right: 0px; height: 115px; padding-top: 0px" title="Preview" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/Presentations/20100326^_BigDays2010^_Azure^_CloudComputing^_Demos.zip" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>&#160; <iframe style="padding-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; padding-left: 0px; width: 98px; padding-right: 0px; height: 115px; padding-top: 0px" title="Preview" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/Presentations/20100326^_BigDays2010^_Azure^_CloudComputing^_Presentation.pdf" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p><strong>Voting Session – Parallel Computing with the .NET Framework 4.0</strong>     <br />In many cases you get in touch with a hot topic from a totally different context. So it was with parallel computing – originally I got in touch with this topic during a project with Frequentis that was all about designing and implementing always responsive applications and services. Read more details and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2009/11/11/arc305-downloads-my-session-teched-europe-in-berlin-on-always-responsive-apps-services.aspx">my whitepaper here and the original ARC-session I delivered at several conferences including TechEd Europe</a>. At BigDays 2010 I delivered a session that focused more on the details of <strong>Task Parallel Library</strong>, <strong>PLINQ</strong> and the new ThreadPool-implementation of .NET. It was so much fun delivering this session, although at one delivery I fall into a trap during the presentation as well – it’s simply not an easy topic, but so interesting:) Click on the icons below to download the presentation and the source code of the demos I created. Furthermore take a look at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/">parallel team’s blog</a> to download the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ParExtSamples">corp-demos from there</a>.</p> <iframe style="padding-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; padding-left: 0px; width: 98px; padding-right: 0px; height: 115px; padding-top: 0px" title="Preview" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/Presentations/20100326^_BigDays2010^_Parallel^_Demos.zip" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>&#160; <iframe style="padding-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; padding-left: 0px; width: 98px; padding-right: 0px; height: 115px; padding-top: 0px" title="Preview" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/Presentations/20100326^_BigDays2010^_Parallel^_Presentation.pdf" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p><strong>Visual Studio 2010 Application Life-Cycle Management – Double-Pack with </strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom"><strong>Max</strong></a>     <br />Delivering a session with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/knom">Max</a> is always great fun and cool. So it was this year at BigDays – the first time we delivered a session together at BigDays although we’re working in the same team for about 4 years, now (damn, time’s moving so fast)! In this session we walked through a complete life-cycle with the new features of VS 2010 in project management, architecture and especially testing. As the code was not so important during this session, I’ll publish the slides, only. <a href="http://www.codefest.at/post/2010/03/30/Big3eDays-2010-Developer-Sessions-zu-Web-Entwicklung-und-Visual-Studio-2010-NET-40-online!.aspx">You should watch the session recording on the session.</a></p> <iframe style="padding-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; padding-left: 0px; width: 98px; padding-right: 0px; height: 115px; padding-top: 0px" title="Preview" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-d37c9d7bfbce8418.skydrive.live.com/embedicon.aspx/Public/Presentations/20100326^_BigDays2010^_VisualStudio2010^_ALM.pdf" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p>If you have any further questions, feel free getting in touch with me. As mentioned, I’ll create some postings with details during the next week.</p></div>
