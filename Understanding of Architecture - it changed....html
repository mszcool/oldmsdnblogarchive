<div id='content'><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">During an internal conference &#8211; Envision &#8211; this week I have attended several architecture sessions about Service Oriented Architecture, Architectural patterns and so forth. Most of them have been interesting, but two have been a far-reaching experience for me. The sessions I am talking about are <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Metropolis</I> from Pat Helland (haven't found a blog - if there is one, I'd&nbsp;be interested in)&nbsp;and an architectural site meeting hosted by <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michael_platt">Michael Platt </A>and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short">Keith Short</A>. Those sessions started me thinking about how my understanding of architecture has changed in the past and currently is changing at all.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">My first thoughts of &#8220;architecture&#8221; were completely different &#8211; I thought about things like class design, design patterns or logical database design as primary tasks of an architect. And &#8211; quite amazing &#8211; this understanding completely changed during the last one and a half year. I recognized that &#8220;being an architect&#8221; has much more facings than I originally thought &#8211; class design or database design are only a couple of trees within a large forest. The forest consists of different applications within the company, across companies; it includes the network infrastructure and its architecture and so on and so forth. But in terms of so many different layers of architecture &#8211; within applications, between applications, mapping to infrastructure and so forth &#8211; the forest view is much larger than I even can imagine now...</SPAN></P></div>
