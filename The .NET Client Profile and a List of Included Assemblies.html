<div id='content'><p>The .NET Client Profile is a very interesting extension made available with the release of .NET Framework 3.5. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc656912.aspx" target="_blank">If you’re interested into more details, follow these link to the official documentation!</a></p>  <p>As a subset of the full .NET Framework package containing client-side functionality, only, it should make the deployment of the .NET Framework for client-only applications in corporate networks easier (30 MB are easier to deploy, maintain and patch than the full Framework with a footprint of more than 100 MB).</p>  <p>So far I was not really challenged with reasons for using the .NET Client Profile from customers – but now it has been the case three different times in series where the deployment of the full framework was a problem for client-only based applications.</p>  <p>Of course one of the first questions customers are asking is: “Which assemblies are included in the client profile and are therefore available for client developers?”</p>  <p>The answer: you can find a list of client-profile assemblies for each version, .NET 2.0, .NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5, in files called “Client.xml” in the following directories on your system:</p>  <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\SubsetList\Client.xml</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">%programfiles%\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0\SubsetList\Client.xml</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Courier New">%programfiles%\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.5\SubsetList\Client.xml</font></p>  <p>Furthermore you can tell Visual Studio 2008 to check your project-references at compile-time by enabling the “Client-only Framework subset” option in the project-properties dialog. In that case Visual Studio comes up with a compiler warning for each assembly you’ve referenced that is not available in the client profile as you can see below:</p>  <p><a href="media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/abb.NETClientProfileListofIncludedAssemb_C94C/image_4.png" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/abb.NETClientProfileListofIncludedAssemb_C94C/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/abb.NETClientProfileListofIncludedAssemb_C94C/image_thumb_1.png" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/abb.NETClientProfileListofIncludedAssemb_C94C/image_thumb_1.png" width="445" height="312" /></a></p>  <p>To get more details on how-to deploy .NET Client Applications using the client-profile just take a closer look at this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc843122.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN-documentation for the .NET Client Profile</a>!</p>  <p>Hope that’s something useful…</p></div>
